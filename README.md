# 📁  A STATIC SITE MAKER

## Webpack / Gulp Build:
This SSG uses gulp-pug & sass - JS & SASS are handled through webpack, php, json data and copying, moving files are handled with Gulp. It creates a static site. WOW!

    # install dependencies
    npm install

    # Run to compile files both handles by both gulp and webpack and launch web server with hot reload (gulp watch only)
    gulp
