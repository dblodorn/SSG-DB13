# 📁  A STATIC SITE MAKER

## Webpack / Gulp Build:

This SSG uses pug for templating - sass for styleeeing - JS grooveeeying. JS bundling is handled through webpack, all the other build automation is done with gulp. It creates a static site in another folder. WOW!!!!!!!

    # install dependencies
    npm install

    # Run to compile files both handles by both gulp and webpack and launch web server with hot reload (gulp watch only)
    gulp


## .........next steps 👟💭
    
    1. Use a JSON file to define style variables that be used in SASS and JS 🔮
    2. Generate multiple pages from one template - create new pages only in JSON 🤔 😱
